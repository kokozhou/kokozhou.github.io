# About Me

I research organizational and policy decision-making related to environmental sustainability, including urban regeneration, net-zero transitions, and  health equity. My research focuses on the messy reality of decision-making: navigating short-term pressures versus long-term goals, balancing economic and social objectives, and bridging diverse stakeholder perspectives in systems.

I combine participatory systems modeling with quantitative methods to both study and support real-world decision-making, including the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, Climate Change Committee, Greater London Authority, and housing associations in the UK.

**Current role**: Senior Research Fellow, University College London  
**Research areas**: Net-zero transitions · Urban regeneration · Health equity · Systems thinking  
**Teaching**: Sustainability governance and urban decision-making
