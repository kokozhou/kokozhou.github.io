## About Me

<div class="about-box">
  <p>
I am a systems scientist specializing in sustainable urban decision-making, with a focus on integrating systems thinking into strategy, management, and public policy. I use systems methods as problem structuring methods. My work spans environmental issues, including social housing, urban regeneration, water neutrality, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and health equity. I collaborate widely with experts in environmental engineering, public health, policy, and management to engage decision-makers and policymakers in achieving healthy and sustainable outcomes. Currently, I work as a researcher at University College London, and have authored over ten publications in leading environmental, health, and management journals.
